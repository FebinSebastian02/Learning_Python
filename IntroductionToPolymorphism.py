#Polymorphism -> Poly = many, morph = form.
#That is, 1 thing can take multiple forms
#eg:- As humans, we are polymorphic because we behave in different forms according to different situation
#In the same way, in OOPs, the objects have different forms

#There are 4 ways to implement Polymorphism:-
#a) Duck typing
#b) Operator overloading
#c) Method overloading
#d) Method overriding
