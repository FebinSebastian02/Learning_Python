#Python is famous as it supports:- a) Functional Programming
#                                  b) Object Oriented Programming
#                                  c) Prodedure Oriented Programming

# Object Oriented Programming has mainly 2 concepts:-
#     1) Objects
#     2) Classes
#
# 1) Objects
# In programming world, we try to solve real world problem with virtual world solution. In real world we use objects for
# our needs and they are important. eg:- A camera is used for taking a photo, a laptop is used to watch movie etc.
# Even humans are treated as objects. eg:- Suppose I have a company and I have a task that needs to be done.
# For completing this task, I need employees. So for me, employees are objects that are assigned tasks to perform.
# These employees also use other objects like AC, fan, laptop etc while working.
#
# Object have 2 things:- a) Attributes b) Behaviours
#
# a) Attributes
# They are properties / data of an object.
# eg:- I as a person is an object. I have a name, age, height etc or I know something. These are my attributes.
# An object have something where we can store data. To store data, we use variables. These are called the attributes
#
# b) Behaviours
# These are the actions done by an object.
# eg:- I as a person is an object. I do reading, walking, sleeping etc or I do something based on what I know. These are my
# behaviours.
# An object will have some behaviour also. To define a behaviour, we need methods. Methods are the functions used in OOP.

# 2) Classes
# All objects in real world like camera, laptop etc are manufactured somewhere.
# eg:- Realme phone I use is not the only phone manufactured. There are millions of same phone manufactured.
# The important thing is where these phones were designed - In realme factory.
# That is, this phone was designed once and manufactured multiple times with the same design.
#
# This design is called Class in OOP and the phones are called Objects in OOP.
#
# Class is also called Blueprint
# Object is called Real stuff / Instance.
# So, object is an instance of a class. The design or class when brought into reality is called object.
#
# Therefore, if we have class, we can make many objects.
